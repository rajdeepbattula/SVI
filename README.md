Social vulnerability, in the words of the CDC, is "the ability of communities to withstand external stresses on human health, such as stresses like natural or human-caused disasters, or disease outbreaks." 
In "A Social Vulnerability Index for Disaster Management," published by Flanagan et al. (2011), 13 metrics are described for evaluating a census tract's "social vulnerability" or "adaptive capacity" (Davies et al. 2018).
These methods are used to implement an index similar to the one maintained by the CDC.

The goal of this study is to assess the ability of a block-group to respond to a particular disruption, minimizing risks to health, 
safety, property, and other important services by closely replicating these indicators at a block group size using 5 year ACS data. 
This score could be used to pinpoint the proper reaction, recovery, and mitigation actions and identify places and communities that are more at risk.
